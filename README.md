# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### The purpose of this analysis is to see if Oahu is a good place to open up a surf shop and ice cream shop. Specifically, we looked at the temperature and precipitation over time. We don't want it to rain too much or too little (to keep the "green" alive) and we don't want it to be too cold for a significant amount of time.

## Results

* The mean temperature in June was about 75 degrees and the mean temperature in December was about 71 degrees
* The 25th and 75th quartiles for June were 73 degrees and 77 degrees, respectively whereas the  25th and 75th quartiles for December were 69 degrees and 74 degrees, respectively
* The standard deviation for June was about 3.25 degrees and the standard deviation for December was about 3.75

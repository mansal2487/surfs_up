# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### The purpose of this analysis is to see if Oahu is a good place to open up a surf shop and ice cream shop. Specifically, we looked at the temperature and precipitation over time. We don't want it to rain too much or too little (to keep the "green" alive) and we don't want it to be too cold for a significant amount of time.

## Results

* The mean temperature in June was about 75 degrees and the mean temperature in December was about 71 degrees
* The 25th and 75th quartiles for June were 73 degrees and 77 degrees, respectively whereas the 25th and 75th quartiles for December were 69 degrees and 74 degrees, respectively
* The standard deviation for June was about 3.25 degrees and the standard deviation for December was about 3.75

## Summary

### The difference between the two mean temperatures is about four degrees. To me, this doesn't sound significant until I take into account that one of the mean temperatures is about 71 degrees. Seeing the temperature in the 60s, at least for me, would more likely than not steer me away from getting ice cream or surfing. This is looked at further with the quartiles. The 25th quartile for December was 69 degrees. It's clear to me that June will be a more lucrative time of the year (not factoring in precipitation) than December.


There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
